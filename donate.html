<h2>You never give me your money...<br />
</h2>
<div id="TEXT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You wanna send me some love, eh? Well, historically I have
not accepted financial contributions. Instead, I encouraged (and still do encourage) users to contribute to 
other open source audio projects such as <a href="http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/Donations">KxStudio</a> or
<a href="http://community.ardour.org/community">Ardour</a>.  I tried to contribute through bartering: I made plugins,
 or a podcast, and others made other projects that we all shared freely. I like that system, but it isn't always enough. This is a rather sensitive subject, but
 I began to feel like plugins have a unique model for raising funds that large scale projects
 such as those don't. Plugins usually reach completion, large projects need continuous funding for specialized developers.<br />
 <br />
 I started tryng to raise money for several reasons. First was because I have previously
 had no expendable income to give to other projects. I hoped to raise money to donate to
 projects that have been valuable to me. Second was because I wanted to turn this hobby partially into a 
 commercial enterprise. This would help my wife feel better about the amount of time I've spent developing.
 <br /><br />
 
 Please keep in mind that I am fully dedicated to open source. I will stop developing before I stop developing 
 open source projects. Commercial projects do not have to be proprietary. 
 
 I decided to experiment with a fund raising campaign employing the <a href="http://www.openavproductions.com/release/">OpenAV Productions release system</a>.
 The original
 release date was set to one year from the announcement. Users donated what they want to move the release date closer. 
 For every $2 USD donated the release date was moved 24 hours closer to the present. At some point the time/money requirements are fulfilled and the source code is released.<br /> <br />

 This system means the plugins are GUARANTEED to be open-sourced even if no-one had donated (luckily that didn't happen).
 Furthermore donations of any size are valuable. Even a $.01 donation would bring the release more than 7 minutes closer. Every contribution makes it
 better for everybody. Therefore every contribution is valuable. Those who have much to give can even free the plugins in a single day if they value
 them at that level.<br /><br />
 
 I still believe in a bartering system. Even during the fundraiser I provided the option to "donate in kind" to free the plugins by making a demo
video on youtube, a bank of presets, bug reports, patch submissions,
writing documentation, starting your own projects etc... even just make
an awesome song and tell everyone you did with with free/opensource
software. Thats what the Linux Audio community really needs even still. 

I was surprised and dissappointed that no-one ever took me up in this regard during the fundraiser. If you do one of these things as a "donation" to Infamous
I'd really like to hear about it. Please email me: (ssjackson71 (at) gmail (dot) com) and let me know. I'll feel good, you'll feel good, and the community will benefit.<br />
 <br />
 SO... The fundraiser was for the GUIs for the original 7 infamous plugins. Their DSP was already released
 so you could preview them as you please using the host generated UI. But if you wanted some sweet eye candy to go
 with them you had to donate or just wait.
 
 They were released on:<br />
 
 <h2 align=center> 7 September 2015</h2>
 <br/>
 Which was about a month sooner than the original date. I really appreciated all the people who contributed, but I expected more to be honest. Then there was an 11 month wait. I made a couple videos about the plugins, trying to generate more advertisement, but that didn't seem to have much effect, so I just hunkered down and sat it out. The deadlock turned out to be good in several ways. One was that it gave me a long testing period. Even though I thought they were done I found several issues during this period. And also I was able to work on some other projects that I'd been considering. So it made me diversify in a good way. Since I was "forced" to set aside this project I worked on porting <a href="http://github.com/ssj71/rkrlv2">Rakarrack to lv2</a> and making an <a href="http://github.com/ssj71/OSC2MIDI">OSC to MIDI bridge</a>.
 <br /> <br />
So the deadlock wasn't all bad for anybody. I was actually planning to do a premature release, but time got away from me and next thing I knew it was time to release. And surprisingly I recieved several kind donations after the release. After the fundraiser! So it paid on both ends. Not a ton, but enough to feel appreciated, and probably more than if I'd have just left a donation button on the site.
 <br />
<br />
 I'll probably do another one someday, but not soon. I'm not sure how I'd change it. If you have suggestions, I'm open to answers.
