<div id="TEXT">Infamous Plugins is developed by Spencer Jackson.<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to develop for some time, and finally after contributing to a
few other projects, I felt like I was ready to take on the challenge.
It has been pretty fun. I also host the <a href="http://opensourcemusician.com">Open Source Musician Podcast</a>
(since episode #60) and raise my family. I work at Icon Health and
Fitness developing code, hardware, and controls for treadmills and
bikes and stuff to help you stay skinny.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you insist on learning more about me check out <a href="http://mountainbikesandtrombones.blogspot.com/">my blog</a> (the first 4
posts are all about me). Thats also the most likely spot to find out about any new development going on.<br />
